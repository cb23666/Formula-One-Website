        <p id="infoAlonso">Fernado Alonso recently penned a multi-year deal until at least the end of the first season of new
            technical regulations in 2026. Alonso has made it clear that he wants to add his tally of two world championship.
            Aston Martin plans to combine their manufacture with Honda and no longer depend on Mercedes as a customer. Alonso will be 45

            <p id="ricciardocarerr">
                A two-race window has been set for Daniel Ricciardo to salvage his Formula One career. Yuki Tsunoda, Ricciardo's teammate, deafeated him in each
                of the first three races of the 2024 Formula One season, and he also has zero points. Daniel Ricciardo is attempting to pursue a Red Bull seat once more, 
                but it appears that his performance will prevent that from occurring. Ricciardo wants to take Sergio Perez spot, but Perez is putting more points than Daniel Ricciardo
                so it looks like Ricciardo won't be driving for Red Bull anytime soon.
