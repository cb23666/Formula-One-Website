            <p id = "history">Formula One was first established in 1946 as the premier single-seater racing category in international motorsport by
             the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) of the FIA, the precursor organization to FISA. It went into action in 1947. 
             The related "Voiturette" formula was called Formula B, Formula II, or Formula 2, while the new "International Formula"
             was first referred to by a variety of names, including Formula A, Formula I, or Formula 1. The 500cc formula was never referred to as "Formula C"
             when it was recognized worldwide as Formula 3 in 1950; instead,
             the three international formulas were "officially" named Formula 1, Formula 2, and Formula 3.
             The approach was initially primarily based on engine capacity-based pre-World War II limitations.
              A new equilibrium between supercharged and regularly aspirated vehicles is anticipated as a result of the rule. 
              Pre-war 1.5-liter supercharged 'voiturettes' were to be defeated by non-supercharged 4.5-liter Grand Prix vehicles,
               but supercharged 3-liter Grand Prix cars were not permitted to compete.
               On May 13, 1950, the United Kingdom's Silverstone Circuit hosted the first world championship event. 
               Giuseppe Farina of Alfa Romeo defeated colleague Juan Manuel Fangio by a small margin to win the inaugural Drivers' World Championship.
                The tournament was won by Fangio in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957. When Michael Schumacher won his sixth World Championship in 2003, 
                the record for the most World Championships won by a single driver was broken. The record had held for 46 years.
